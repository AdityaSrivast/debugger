##### Active
Active Community Members are visibly active in Slack and/or Github channels. We identify active members as being those who contributors and staff can most count on for a response within 2-3 days.

##### On Break
From time to time, and for many reasons that life gives us, one of our community team members may need reduce or pause their involvement for a while.  We might still see them in Slack, or commenting in bugs, but we have no expectations of regular availability.

##### Alumni
Alumni status honours those who have dedicated time and energy to the Debugger project, but for many reasons have needed to step back.  We want to make sure they remain as a visible part of Debugger's bistory and success.

 **Thank you Debugger Alumni!**
